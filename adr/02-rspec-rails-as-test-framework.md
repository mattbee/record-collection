# 2. Use RSpec for tests

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Test Driven Development is my preferred way of working and in my opinion the best way to build software. So we need something that helps make testing easier.

## Decision
Use RSpec Rails (and Factory Bot for data fixtures/generation) as I prefer it to minitest (and others). It's also incredibly popular and likely Logikcull use it for Rails testing.

## Consequences
Only a good testing experience and speedier TDD thanks to familiarity.
