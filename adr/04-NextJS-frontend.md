# 3. Use Next JS for front end

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Greg needs to interact with the database somehow, and this web User Interface should allow him to view and edit his record collection.

## Decision
The Front end should probably be React, as Logikcull are moving that way and I am familiar with React. Next JS Should give us simple routing and server side rendering too, which are all useful in React apps.


## Consequences
NextJS will have a slight learning curve and there will be things I don't know about that will slow me down. Benefits should outweigh the downsides though.
